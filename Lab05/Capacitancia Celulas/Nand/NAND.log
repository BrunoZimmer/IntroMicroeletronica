Notice from spectre during transient analysis `DifTempo-017_DifTempo', during task `MDLControl'.
    Trapezoidal ringing is detected during tran analysis.
        Please use method=trap for better results and performance.


Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(X1.M_i_3__m0_x2__m1:sbnode) = 1 V
I: I(Vd:p) = 51.05 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

    Trapezoidal ringing is detected during tran analysis.
        Please use method=trap for better results and performance.


Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(X1.M_i_2__m0_x2__m0:sbnode) = 1 V
I: I(Vd:p) = 257.5 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

During simulation, the CPU load for active processors is :
        Spectre  0 (46.4 %)      1 (38.6 %)      2 (52.3 %)      3 (28.9 %)
        Other   
Initial condition solution time: CPU = 505 us, elapsed = 506.878 us.
Intrinsic tran analysis time:    CPU = 10.707 ms, elapsed = 34.7471 ms.
Total time required for tran analysis `DifTempo-048_DifTempo': CPU = 12.274 ms, elapsed = 36.315 ms.
Time accumulated: CPU = 1.30966 s, elapsed = 5.0021 s.
Peak resident memory used = 65 Mbytes.


Aggregate audit (11:24:01 AM, Thur Jan 9, 2020):
Time used: CPU = 1.31 s, elapsed = 5.05 s, util. = 26%.
Time spent in licensing: elapsed = 32.4 ms.
Peak memory used = 65.4 Mbytes.
Simulation started at: 11:23:56 AM, Thur Jan 9, 2020, ended at: 11:24:01 AM, Thur Jan 9, 2020, with elapsed time (wall clock): 5.05 s.
spectre completes with 0 errors, 3 warnings, and 389 notices.

During simulation, the CPU load for active processors is :
        Spectre  0 (50.4 %)      1 (83.2 %)      2 (100.0 %)     3 (47.9 %)
        Other   
Initial condition solution time: CPU = 522 us, elapsed = 532.15 us.
Intrinsic tran analysis time:    CPU = 11.733 ms, elapsed = 35.666 ms.
Total time required for tran analysis `RiseTime-048_RiseTime': CPU = 13.697 ms, elapsed = 37.852 ms.
Time accumulated: CPU = 1.41533 s, elapsed = 5.55702 s.
Peak resident memory used = 65 Mbytes.


Aggregate audit (12:38:05 PM, Mon Jan 13, 2020):

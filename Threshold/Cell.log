DC Analysis `srcSweep': Vdd = (0 -> 1)
**************************************

Notice from spectre during DC analysis `srcSweep'.
    No outputs were found. Loosening output filter criterion to `allpub'.

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(Drain) = 1 V
I: I(Vs:p) = 227.7 uA
DC simulation time: CPU = 10.387 ms, elapsed = 25.0428 ms.

Notice from spectre at Vdd = 1 during DC analysis `srcSweep'.
    The value of parameter 'Vdd' has been reset to the original value 1.

Total time required for dc analysis `srcSweep': CPU = 10.436 ms, elapsed = 25.094 ms.
Time accumulated: CPU = 194.086 ms, elapsed = 229.876 ms.
Peak resident memory used = 52.8 Mbytes.


Aggregate audit (11:40:05 AM, Mon Mar 2, 2020):
Time used: CPU = 196 ms, elapsed = 251 ms, util. = 78.1%.
Time spent in licensing: elapsed = 23 ms, percentage of total = 9.18%.
Peak memory used = 53.2 Mbytes.
Simulation started at: 11:40:04 AM, Mon Mar 2, 2020, ended at: 11:40:05 AM, Mon Mar 2, 2020, with elapsed time (wall clock): 251 ms.
